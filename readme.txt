Thoughts and comments:
I found google's VRView to be super helpful for this project. My one point of frustration was on the lack of documentation regarding setting up hotspots.
The main page 
https://developers.google.com/vr/concepts/vrview-web
doesn't go into much depth and I found the actual code repo to be more useful.
